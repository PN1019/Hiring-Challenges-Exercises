Problem Statement :
Based on the provided data and assumptions please:

Calculate Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for the solar project alone;
Calculate the volume weighted average market revenue for the solar project, and compare this against the LCOE;
Devise a model that utilises energy storage to shift solar energy to higher price periods

a.  Note that degrees of freedom include storage sizes on a MW and MWh basis
Calculate new volume weighted average market revenues and compare to changed LCOE (due to storage addition) and new market revenue IRRâ€™s and comment.
