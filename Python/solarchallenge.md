## Data : https://github.com/PN1019/Hiring-Challenges-Exercises/blob/main/Python/solar_generation_energy_price.csv
## Problem Statement :
Based on the provided data and assumptions do the following tasks:

1. Calculate Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for the solar project alone;
2. Calculate the volume weighted average market revenue for the solar project, and compare this against the LCOE;
3. Devise a model that utilises energy storage to shift solar energy to higher price periods
      a.  Note that degrees of freedom include storage sizes on a MW and MWh basis
4. Calculate new volume weighted average market revenues and compare to changed LCOE (due to storage addition) and new market revenue IRRâ€™s and comment.
