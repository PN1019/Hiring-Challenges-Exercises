Devise a model that utilises energy storage to shift solar energy to higher price periods,& \n## 4. Calculate new volume weighted average market revenues, compare to changed LCOE (due to storage addition) and new market revenue IRR’s and comment.\nIn order to write down a rule for the storage system, the starting point is to impose the energy balance, between the PV unit, the storage system, and the network. Using a single bus bar model, the elements are described as they were all connected to a single bar:\n\nPpv(t) + Pnet(t) + Pst(t) = 0\n\nPpv(t) is the power provided by the PV unit in [MW];\nPst(t) in [MW] represents the power exchanged with the storage system, and is negative if it's absorbed;\nPnet (t) in [kW] is the variable that represents the power exchanged with the external grid.\nThe goal would be to exploit the storage system to maximise energy sale to the network:\n\nPnet (t) ≤ 0 , ∀t.\n\nThere are many possibilities to define the model. The idea is to define a model to evaluate the profit that depends on both storage size and energy prices. This model sells the energy of the storage only when the energy price is above a certain threshold (discharge phase), otherwise it would take the energy from the PV production (charge phase).\n\nLet us see how the charge and discharge phases are defined.\n\nA) In case of energy price below the threshold, the storage system can be charged absorbing the energy produced according to its limits.\n\nThe bounds of the storage system have to be verified in terms of maximum power allowed during charging phase (a charge/discharge power factor of 0.3 is assumed), and in terms of maximum stored energy. So Pst(t) is given by the most restrictive criterion.\n\nMoreover, implementing a cycle within the numerical code, at each time step the storage system is updated with the new state of charge. If the storage reaches its limits, a residual energy in excess would be sold to the network, in order to accomplish the energy balance.\n\nTherefore, the system is described by the following set of equations :\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def charge_phase(sg,wmax,Wst0,etain):\n    pst     =   max([-sg,-0.3*wmax, (Wst0-wmax)/(etain)])\n    wst     =   -etain * pst + Wst0\n    pnet    =   -sg - pst\n    return pst, pnet, wst\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-09T10:39:11.138684Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-09T10:39:11.139163Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-09T10:39:11.151484Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-09T10:39:11.13911Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-09T10:39:11.150753Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"B) In case of energy price above the threshold, the energy (both of the storage and PV) is sold to the network.
